Simple boxes for aleatoric music

AleBoxes is a simple text font that makes it easy to draw boxes. For a short box, type AaaaaA. To make it wider, type AaaaaaaaaaaaaA.

For a taller box, try BbbbB, or CccccC... all the way up to WwwwwwwW.

AleBoxes was designed for drawing aleatoric boxes, but feel free to use it wherever boxes are needed. It's quite simple at the moment, but I might be persuade to expand it if there's a need.

You can also make basic lines:

-Thin line: 1 or 2, arrow is @
-Medium-thin line: 3, ending bar is 4, arrow is $
-Medium line: 5, ending bar is 6, arrow is ^
-Thick line: 7, ending bar is 8, arrow is *
-Thickest line: 9, ending bar is 0, arrow is )

-Thin wavy line: colon, ending bar is 6
-Thick wavy line: semicolon, ending bar is 0

These lines aren't centered on any particular boxes; if you want them centered, you'll need to change their baselines manually.
